NAME
    AMBERDASH - Dash interface for Amber trajectories

SYNOPSIS
    amberdash [options] *seed* [-- *dash_options*]

    Run dash on trajectories generated by the Amber molecular dynamics
    package (http://ambermd.org/).

OPTIONS
    -help
        Print help message and exit.

    -version
        Print version number and exit.

    -debug
        Print progress messages on stderr.

    -keep
        Keep all the intermediate files that are normally deleted when the
        program exits.

    -keep-dash-input
        Keep the dash input file *seed*.dash.in which is normally deleted
        when the program exits.

    -keep-ptraj-input
        Keep the ptraj input file *seed*.ptraj.in which is normally deleted
        when the program exits.

    -no-dash
        Generate (and keep) the dash input file *seed*.dash.in but do not
        run dash.

    -progress
        Print output from the ptraj command on stdout. Useful for monitoring
        progress when reading large trajectories.

    -snap
        Write PDB files containing snapshots representing the dash states.

    -backbone *r1*:*r2*
        Analyze the sequence of backbone torsion angles from residue *r1* to
        residue *r2*.

DASH OPTIONS
    The *dash_options* are described in the dash documentation. The dash
    flags *-N* (number of frames) and *-T* (number of torsions) are not
    required; they are supplied automatically by amberdash.

INPUT FILES
    Several input files are required, specified by the *seed* prefix, in
    order to identify the topology, the torsion angles and the trajectory.

    The topology is always specified by an Amber topology file *seed*.top.

    The torsion angles may be specified either by the -backbone option or by
    a file *seed*.tor. The -backbone option takes precedence.

    The trajectory may be specified either as a single Amber trajectory file
    *seed*.trj, or by a sequence of trajin commands in a text file
    *seed*.trajin. If *seed*.trajin exists, it is used and *seed*.trj is
    ignored; otherwise *seed*.trj is used. The *seed*.trajin approach is
    necessary if the trajectory spans several files or a subset of the
    trajectory is required via *start*, *stop* and *offset* arguments to
    trajin.

    If snapshots are required (-snap) and the trajectory is specified in
    *seed*.trajin, the trajin commands in *seed*.trajin must include start,
    stop and offset fields. Otherwise the script is unable to locate the
    representative dash states in the trajectory and the snapshots are
    omitted.

    *seed*.top
        An Amber topology file corresponding to the trajectory to be
        analyzed.

    *seed*.trajin
        A text file containing trajin commands to extract the trajectory to
        be analyzed. Any lines not containing trajin commands are ignored.

    *seed*.trj
        An Amber trajectory file.

    *seed*.tor
        A text file defining the torsion angles to be analyzed. Each torsion
        angle is specified by a whitespace-separated line with five fields:

            name mask1 mask2 mask3 mask4

        Here *name* is an identifier and *mask1*, ..., *mask4* are Amber
        atom masks defining the torsion angle. Lines starting with '#' are
        treated as comments and ignored. This file must be prepared manually
        by the user.

OUTPUT FILES
    *seed*.dash.out
        The dash output file.

    *seed*.ptraj.out
        The output from the ptraj command to extract the torsions.

    If -snap is specified, the following files are written for each dash
    state:

        *seed*.state*N*.*frame*
            The PDB file containing the representative frame *frame* for
            dash state *N*.

        *seed*.ptraj.state*N*.out
            The output from the ptraj command to generate the PDB file for
            dash state *N*.

    If -keep is specified, the following intermediate files are retained:

        *seed*.ptraj.in
            The input file for the ptraj command to extract the torsions.

        *seed*.*name*
            The torsion angles for each torsion *name*.

        *seed*.dash.in
            The dash input file obtained by joining the torsion angle files.

    If -keep-ptraj and -snap are specified, the following files are
    retained:

        *seed*.ptraj.state*N*.in
            The input file for the ptraj command to generate the PDB file
            for dash state *N*.

INSTALLATION
    The programs dash and either ptraj or cpptraj are required. If they are
    not on the PATH their full pathnames must be specified at the top of the
    amberdash script. cpptraj reads large trajectories faster than ptraj,
    while ptraj calculates statistics for the torsion angles.

NOTE
    All the output files will be clobbered by the next run of the script for
    the same *seed*.
